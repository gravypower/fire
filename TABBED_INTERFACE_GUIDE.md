# Tabbed Interface Guide

## Overview

The Finance Simulation Tool now uses a clean tabbed interface to separate configuration from results, giving you more space and a better workflow.

## The Two Tabs

### 🛠️ Configure Tab

**Purpose**: Set up all your financial parameters

**What's Inside**:
1. **Input Parameters**
   - Income (salary, frequency, tax brackets)
   - Expenses (legacy fields with note about Expense Tracker)
   - Loans & Mortgage (principal, interest, payments, offset account)
   - Investments (contributions, returns, current balance)
   - Superannuation (contribution rate, returns, current balance)
   - Retirement (desired income, ages)
   - Simulation (years to project)

2. **Expense Tracker** 💰
   - Add individual expenses with different frequencies
   - Organize by category
   - Use templates for quick setup
   - Enable/disable expenses
   - See monthly totals

3. **Transition Manager** 🔄
   - Add life events (retirement, career changes, etc.)
   - Set transition dates
   - Modify parameters at specific times
   - Use templates for common transitions

**Layout**: Full-width, single column, scrollable

### 📊 Results Tab

**Purpose**: View your financial projections and analysis

**What's Inside**:
1. **Comparison View** (if transitions exist)
   - Side-by-side comparison of scenarios
   - With vs without transitions
   - Impact metrics

2. **Financial Projection Results**

## Workflow

### Typical Usage Flow

1. **Start in Configure Tab** (default)
   - Enter your basic financial information
   - Add individual expenses in Expense Tracker
   - Optionally add life event transitions

2. **Automatic Switch to Results**
   - When you make changes, simulation runs automatically
   - App switches to Results tab to show updated projections
   - "Ready" badge appears on Results tab

3. **Review Results**
   - Check key metrics
   - Review charts and timeline
   - Look for warnings or issues

4. **Iterate**
   - Switch back to Configure tab
   - Adjust parameters
   - App automatically switches to Results again

### Manual Tab Switching

Click the tab headers at any time:
- **Configure** tab: Settings icon + "Configure" label
- **Results** tab: Chart icon + "Results" label + status badge

## Benefits of Tabbed Layout

### ✅ More Space

- No cramped sidebars
- Better visibility of charts and tables

### ✅ Better Focus
- Configure without distraction from results
- View results without configuration clutter
- Clear mental separation of tasks

### ✅ Improved Workflow
- Auto-switch to results when simulation completes
- Easy manual switching between tabs
- Status badge shows when results are ready

### ✅ Mobile Friendly
- Tabs work great on smaller screens
- No side-by-side layout to squeeze
- Natural scrolling within each tab

## Status Indicators

### Results Tab Badge
- **"Ready"** (green): Simulation has completed, results available
- **No badge**: No results yet, configure parameters first

### Empty States

**Configure Tab (no config)**:
- Welcome message
- Instructions to enter parameters
- Privacy notice

**Results Tab (no results)**:
- "No Results Yet" message

## Tips

1. **Start Fresh**: Begin in Configure tab, enter all parameters
