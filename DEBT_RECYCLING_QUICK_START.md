# Debt Recycling - Quick Start Guide

## What is Debt Recycling?

Debt recycling is a tax strategy where you claim loan interest as a tax deduction, reducing your taxable income. This is typically used for investment loans where borrowed funds are used to purchase income-producing assets.

## Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Add or Edit a Loan

1. Scroll to the **"Loans & Mortgages"** section
2. Click **"+ Add Loan"** or edit an existing loan
3. Fill in the loan details:
   - **Label**: e.g., "Investment Property Loan"
   - **Principal Balance**: Outstanding loan amount
   - **Interest Rate**: Annual interest rate (%)
   - **Payment Amount**: Regular payment amount
   - **Payment Frequency**: How often you pay

### Step 2: Enable Debt Recycling

1. Scroll down to the **green "Enable Debt Recycling"** section
2. Check the box: ✅ **"Enable Debt Recycling (Tax Deductible Interest)"**
3. Read the warning about proper usage

### Step 3: Run Your Simulation

Click the **"Run Simulation"** button to see:

- **Improved cash flow** from tax savings
- **Better retirement outcomes** over time

## Example

### Before Debt Recycling:
- Annual Income: $100,000
- Loan Interest: $20,000
- Taxable Income: $100,000
- Tax Paid: $24,497 (using AU tax brackets)

### After Enabling Debt Recycling:
- Annual Income: $100,000
- Loan Interest: $20,000 (deductible)
- Taxable Income: $80,000
- Tax Paid: $17,547
- **Tax Savings: $6,950 per year!**

## When to Use

✅ **Use debt recycling for:**
- Investment property loans
- Margin loans for shares
- Business loans for income-producing activities

❌ **Don't use for:**
- Owner-occupied home loans
- Personal loans
- Car loans (unless for business)

## Important Warning

⚠️ **Tax Compliance Required**

Debt recycling has specific tax rules. The borrowed funds **must** be used for income-producing investments. Always consult a tax professional before implementing this strategy.

## Combining with Offset Accounts

You can use both features together:
- **Offset Account**: Reduces interest charged (saves money)
- **Debt Recycling**: Makes remaining interest tax deductible (saves tax)

Example:
- Loan: $400,000 at 6%
- Offset: $100,000
- Interest charged: $300,000 × 6% = $18,000
- Tax deduction: $18,000 (if debt recycling enabled)
- At 37% tax rate: Save $6,660 in tax

## Tips

1. **Higher income = bigger benefit**: The higher your marginal tax rate, the more you save
2. **Track over time**: Watch your cumulative tax savings in the simulation timeline
3. **Compare scenarios**: Run simulations with and without debt recycling to see the difference
4. **Professional advice**: Always consult a tax professional for your specific situation
